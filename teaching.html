      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      <p>
        I teach by giving students small pieces of expertise and challenging them to build something bigger.
        I find that building strong social ties and community in the classroom is the best catalyst for deep and meaningful learing.  
        I'm also fascinated with metacognition and critical thinking, and encourage my students to question how and what they are learning at all times.

      Current and past students can find course materials on the univerity LMS platform (e.g. Brightspace).
        <!--Sample materials that I have developed and used in the past can be found below my teaching experience.-->
