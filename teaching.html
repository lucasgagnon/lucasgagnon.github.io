      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      <p>
        Good math teaching gives the learner small, structured pieces of expertise and encourages them to creating something new and amazing with it.  
        While guiding students through this process, my bias is toward building metacognitive and communivation skills.  
        In the classroom, this looks like an emphasis on community and peer discussion, with inquiry-based activities, presentations, and think-pair-share activities throughout the hour.

      Current and past students can find course materials on the univerity LMS platform or printed out in class.
        <!--Sample materials that I have developed and used in the past can be found below my teaching experience.-->
